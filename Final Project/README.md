# REANDME

Our study examines the burgeoning data science job market, highlighting its job security, competitive salaries, and growth opportunities. We detail the high demand for data scientists across industries, particularly in Information Technology, and the essential skills required, such as proficiency in R, Tableau, databases, and programming languages like Python. The analysis reveals varying hiring patterns and emphasizes California's significant role in job availability. It also notes a salary range of $60,000 to $220,000, with many earning between $100,000 and $140,000. Future research may explore technology's impact on this field and regional job market comparisons.



This repository contains the 220_Final_report.pdf, which is the comprehensive final report of our study. The Jupyter notebooks handshake_data.ipynb, indeed_data.ipynb, glassdoor_data.ipynb, and simplyhired_data.ipynb contain scripts for scraping job posting data from respective websites. Analysis of Indeed's data is conducted in Indeed_data_processing.ipynb, while analyses for Glassdoor and SimplyHired are within their respective notebooks. Interactive LDA visualization charts of SimplyHired's text data are found in benefits_lda.html and qual_lda.html. Additionally, scraped datasets are included as simplyhired_jobs_detail.json, glassdoor_job_details.csv, and living_cost.csv.
